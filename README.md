# Seth-Samantha-CLI-App
Our super cool RPG (probably)

short description of program 

Installation Requirement: 

In order to run the application you will need the following Ruby gems: activerecord, sqlite3, sinatra, sinatra-activerecord, require_all, pry, tty-prompt, and rainbow.

There are 2 different ways you can ensure the gems are on your computer for the application. One way is to run the bundle install in your terminal once the repo has been downloaded. The other way is to do a gem install for each of the gems. 

The application also runs off of a database. To ensure the database is set up, run rake db:migrate and then rake db:seed. 

Once the gems and the database has been set up, you are ready to run the application. To do this type in ruby runner.rb from the root directory.
